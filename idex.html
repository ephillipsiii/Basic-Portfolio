            <p>Served in a 16-ounce pint glass. Cloudy and dirty-peach-colored, topped with a thick, frothy, creamy foam head with great retention and stick, thanks to the hops. Spicy, floral hop aroma with sweetish pale malts beneath. Near full-bodied, incredibly smooth on the palate, creamy and silky. Sharpish citric snap up front, with notes of grapefruit, lime and lemon; deep floral notes as well. A tad resinous, a little piney, especially in the hop finish, which is puckering and drying. Sweet, bready malts with some fruitiness and a doughy yeast toward the end. Lingering hop spiciness and yeast in the finish. Very moreish and bone dry when the last sip fades away.
            </p>

            <p>The 12-ounce bottle pours a pitch-black, topped with a creamy tan-colored head that leaves a healthy ringed lace as it settles, with a bit of stick on the glass. Deep roasted malts, some acrid notes, blackstrap molasses, fresh grist, moist earth, and hints of chocolate and coffee grounds. Nearly medium-bodied, with a mineral-tasting and slightly sweet malty roundness. Some carbonation-induced creaminess on the palate segues to an expected dryness and tangy, astringent roasted barley bite. A touch of hop bitterness provides some citric edge and melds with the acridness of the brew for a perceived sourness. Smoky characters emerge as the beer warms, as do subtle drops of caramel. The overall dryness of the beer carries through to the finish, with a semi-burnt linger and bitter end.
